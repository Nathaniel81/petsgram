# Petsgram

**Petsgram** is a mobile-first pets photo-sharing application built with **React Native** (frontend) and **Django** (backend). The app allows users to create posts by sharing their pets' photos.

## Features (In Progress):
* AI-powered image validation: Ensures that only pet photos can be uploaded. Posts will only be created if the image is confirmed to be a pet.
* User registration and authentication.
* Image storage and retrieval.

## Tech Stack:
* __Frontend__: React Native
* __Backend__: Django (REST API)
* __AI Integration__: Image validation during post creation (coming soon).

## To-Do:
* Integrate AI for image validation.
* Implement post creation with validated pet photos.
